\title{Refit bootstrap replicates that failed to converge in a call to \code{cor_phylo}}
\usage{
refit_boots(cp_obj, inds = NULL, ...)

\method{print}{cp_refits}(x, digits = max(3, getOption("digits") - 3), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cp_obj}{The original \code{cor_phylo} object that was bootstrapped.}

\item{inds}{Vector of indices indicating the bootstraps you want to refit.
This is useful if you want to try refitting only a portion of bootstrap
replicates.
By passing \code{NULL}, it refits all bootstrap replicates present in
\code{cp_obj$bootstrap$mats}.
If, in the original call to \code{cor_phylo}, \code{keep_boots} was set to
\code{"fail"}, then any successful replicates cannot be refit here.
An error will be thrown if you use \code{inds} to request a successful rep
to be refit when \code{keep_boots} was set to \code{"fail"}.
Any bootstrap replicates not present in \code{inds} will have \code{NA} in the output
object.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Arguments that should be changed from the original call to \code{cor_phylo}.
The \code{boot} argument is always set to \code{0} for refits because you don't want
to bootstrap your bootstraps.}

\item{x}{an object of class \code{cp_refits}.}

\item{digits}{the number of digits to be printed.}
}
\value{
A \code{cp_refits} object, which is a list of \code{cor_phylo} objects
corresponding to each matrix in \verb{<original cor_phylo object>$bootstrap$mats}.
}
\description{
This function is to be called on a \code{cor_phylo} object if one or more bootstrap
replicates fail to converge.
It allows the user to change parameters for the optimizer to get it to converge.
One or more of the resulting \code{cp_refits} object(s) can be supplied to
\code{boot_ci} along with the original \code{cor_phylo} object to calculate confidence
intervals from only bootstrap replicates that converged.
