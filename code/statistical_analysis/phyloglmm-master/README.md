# phyloglmm

Fit uncorrelated intercept slope glmms using pez and lme4

## Todo

- single site simulation (problematic, not sure why it doesn't work)
- multivariate simulation to get correlation between slopes and intercepts
- extend example with MCMCglmm, glmmTMB, gls, PGLMM, brms
- what is caper? there is a function call pgls
